**[GRAD-MAP](https://www.umdgradmap.org/) (Graduate Resources Advancing Diversity with Maryland Astronomy and Physics)** is a graduate-student-led diversity initiative at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The goal of GRAD-MAP is to connect UMCP faculty and students with those at minority serving institutions (MSIs) for the benefit of both institutions. We aim to connect students who may not have many research opportunities with the facilities and research at UMCP. We do this by setting up visits with undergraduates at MSIs as well as our Winter Workshop, a one week research and professional development experience. Please share the information and blurb below with any undergraduates that may be interested.

GRAD-MAP is organizing an **[Open House](https://www.umdgradmap.org/fall-open-house)** event on **Tuesday, November 10, at 6 PM via Zoom**, open to undergraduate students primarily from MSIs. The purpose of this event is to share research going on at the UMCP Physics and Astronomy Departments, how to get into graduate school, graduate student life, and career paths with a PhD. Following presentations, we will have a socializing segment including a conversation and discussion with graduate students. If you would like to learn how to get involved with research at UMCP and learn more about the **[GRAD-MAP Winter Workshop](https://www.umdgradmap.org/winter-workshop)**, a week long research and professional development experience, please register [here](https://forms.gle/ENZdo3BTPHz1FjcDA).
